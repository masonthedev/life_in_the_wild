					<p class="description">Wild horses, often referred to as mustangs in North America, are free-roaming horses that are descended from domesticated horses brought by Europeans in the 16th century. Unlike truly wild horse species such as the Przewalski's horse, mustangs are feral animals, meaning they are descendants of once-domesticated horses that have adapted to living in the wild. These horses are known for their hardiness, agility, and ability to survive in harsh environments. In the United States, they are protected by law under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971.</p>

					<p class="description">Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, known for their impressive size, intelligence, and social structure. There are three species of elephants: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephants are highly social creatures, living in matriarchal family groups led by the oldest female. They have remarkable memories, which aid in their ability to navigate and find water sources over large distances. Elephants also play a crucial role in their ecosystems by facilitating seed dispersal and creating pathways in dense forested areas. Their population has been under threat due to habitat loss and poaching, primarily for their ivory tusks.</p>

					<p class="description">Koi fish, originally from Japan, are colorful varieties of the Amur carp (Cyprinus rubrofuscus) that are kept for decorative purposes in outdoor ponds and water gardens. Known for their vibrant colors and patterns, koi are a symbol of luck, prosperity, and good fortune in Japanese culture. They can live for several decades, with some individuals reaching over 50 years of age. Koi are hardy fish that can adapt to a wide range of climates and water conditions, and they are also known for their friendly behavior, often coming to the surface to be fed by hand.</p>

					<p class="description">Flamingos are large, social wading birds known for their striking pink or reddish feathers, long legs, and distinctive downward-bending bills. There are six species of flamingos, found in parts of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. The pink coloration of their feathers comes from carotenoid pigments in their diet, primarily derived from algae and crustaceans. Flamingos are highly social, often living in colonies that can number in the thousands. They engage in synchronized group behaviors such as feeding, preening, and even mating dances. These birds are also known for their unique method of feeding, using their specialized bills to filter food from water.</p>

					<p class="description">Lemurs are primates native to the island of Madagascar and the nearby Comoros Islands. They are known for their large, reflective eyes, which aid their nocturnal lifestyle, and their long, bushy tails, which help with balance. There are over 100 species of lemurs, ranging in size from the tiny mouse lemur to the larger indri. Lemurs are highly adaptable, living in a variety of habitats from rainforests to dry deciduous forests. They are primarily arboreal, spending much of their time in trees. Lemurs have a diverse diet that includes fruits, leaves, flowers, and insects. Many species are threatened or endangered due to habitat destruction and hunting, making conservation efforts critical for their survival.</p>

					<p class="description">Barbary macaques, also known as Barbary apes, are primates native to the Atlas Mountains of Algeria and Morocco, with a small introduced population in Gibraltar. Despite being called apes, they are actually monkeys and are the only macaque species found outside Asia. They are distinguished by their lack of a tail, which gives them an ape-like appearance. These monkeys live in social groups with a complex social structure and exhibit a high degree of social bonding and grooming behaviors. Barbary macaques are endangered due to habitat loss, hunting, and the pet trade, making them a focus of conservation efforts.</p>
